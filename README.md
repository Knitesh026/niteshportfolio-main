# Project Setup

## Fixing Vite Issues

If you encounter issues with the `vite` module, follow these steps:

1. Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   ```

2. Reinstall dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Ensure `vite` is installed as a dev dependency:
   ```bash
   npm install vite --save-dev
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Verify your Node.js version is compatible (16.x or 18.x recommended):
   ```bash
   node -v
   ```

6. Clear npm cache if issues persist:
   ```bash
   npm cache clean --force
   npm install
   ```

For further assistance, refer to the Vite documentation or contact the project maintainer.
